pinball example to show the "pass through wall" issue

At high velocity the ball pass through the flippers. I thank that bullet mode will fix this... and YES but the ball behaviour become sticky.

You can change to isBullet by clicking the checkbox bottom left.

If you have any idea on how a reliable collision can be handled please let me know!!  :)
